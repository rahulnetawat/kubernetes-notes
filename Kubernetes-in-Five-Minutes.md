The areas that Kubernetes natively accounts for in logical order are:

1. Hardware â€“ Node
2. Orchestration â€“ Deployment, Job, CronJob, StatefulSet, DaemonSet
3. Configuration â€“ ConfigMap, Secret
4. Persistence â€” PersistentVolumeClaim, PersistentVolume
5. Execution â€“ Pod, ReplicaSet
6. Access Control â€“ Namespace, ServiceAccount, Role, ClusterRole
7. Exposure â€“ Service, Ingress

# Hardware

All software has one fundamental dependency: a machine to run on. We need hardware whether itâ€™s our own computers or someone else's and this abstraction comes in the form of a Node resource type.

1. Node: Represents a logical machine/VM (eg. your computer, ec2 instance, a droplet).

# Orchestration

After we've defined our hardware, we need a plan on how to deploy our application. Will it be a single instance? Do we need maybe two? When we need to update our application, should it be done one by one or all at once? Do we want it to be deployed across all our Nodes? Should it be run once every day at 3 AM? We need to orchestrate the deployment.

1. Deployment: Long-standing workloads (eg. a server)
2. Job: One-off workload (eg. a shell script/database migration task)
3. CronJob: Periodically-run one-off workload (eg. data sync task)
4. StatefulSet: Workloads that require a readable/writable data volume (hard disk) that persists beyond restarts and is not shared amongst other instances of the same application. Use cases include services that implement eventual consistency (eg. transactional databases)
5. DaemonSet: Workloads that should be distributed across all targeted Nodes (eg. log collectors, system monitors, security software)

# Configuration
So we've got a plan, but applications tend to be a fickle bunch and also need to be told certain things at runtime instead of plan-time; Things such as which network interface to bind to, which port to listen on, which API keys to use et cetera. While these things can technically be hard-coded, best-practices of 2020 generally suggest they should not. So we need a way to configure our application at runtime.

1. ConfigMap: Stores configuration for mounting as environment variables or read-only files (eg. SERVER_PORT=8080)
2. Secret: Fundamentally the same but stored in Base64 encoded text and used for values that should not be stored in plaintext (eg. GITHUB_API_TOKEN=ðŸ˜±)

# Persistence
Now what if our application handles files and requires a hard disk that it can read and write from across different versions and instances? We need our data to persist by providing our applicationâ€™s system with a hard disk (AKA volume in technical terms).

1. PersistentVolume: A logical "hard drive" (eg. Seagate 2TB, EBS)
2. PersistentVolumeClaim: Binds a PersistentVolume to a Pod. This is more of a virtual construct: think of it as the act of mounting a hard drive. A PVC defines that intention to mount a hard drive and expose its filesystem for an application to use.
